Romans 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness [kainotes] of life.

Kainotes is a greek word that is translated "newness" in the new testament. 

E.W. Bullinger defines it as "fresh, new, never contaminated"🌿🌿 like pulling off the plastic of a brand-new MacBook. 💻

My thought behind this app is to simply add more word daily into our lives, reminding us to walk in newness of life.
